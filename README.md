# Catalyst Demo

To run the Catalyst demo, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

If `npm run lint` or other scripts fail with errors such as `next: not found` or "Module not found: Can't resolve '@fullcalendar/react'", ensure that the npm dependencies are installed successfully. Run `npm install` again and verify that your environment allows network access to the npm registry.
